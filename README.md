# Amazon-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

This project is a sentiment analysis tool for Amazon product reviews. It allows users to input a sentence or upload a CSV file of reviews and returns whether the sentiment is Positive or Negative using a trained machine learning model. The tool features a clean web interface built with Streamlit and an API backend powered by Flask.
